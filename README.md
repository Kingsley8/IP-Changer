## IP Changer with Tor
TOR IP Changer does not alter your router's IP address; instead, it creates a proxy inside the TOR network that you may use to mask your actual IP address in browsers and apps that support socks4/5 type proxy, and you can change that IP within the TOR network every X seconds. Most of the time, it's simply for browsers, but you may use third-party software in conjunction with TOR IP changer to anonymize not just browsers, but also other software that don't support socks4/5 proxy.
